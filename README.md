# 🍴 Personalized Recipe Generator
### 📌 Project Overview

The Personalized Recipe Generator is an AI-powered web application that helps users create customized recipes based on their available ingredients, dietary preferences, and time or nutrition constraints. It uses Generative AI to generate step-by-step cooking instructions, suggest alternatives for missing items, and provide nutritional breakdowns.

This project demonstrates how AI + Web Development can be combined to solve a real-world problem of food planning and reduce food waste.

### 🚀 Features
